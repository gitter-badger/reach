# What is it?

Reach stands for **Re**ading and **A**ssembling **C**ontextual and **H**olistic Mechanisms from Text. In plain English, Reach is an information extraction system for the biomedical domain, which aims to read scientific literature and extract cancer signaling pathways. Reach implements a fairly complete extraction pipeline, including: recognition of biochemical entities (proteins, chemicals, etc.), grounding them to known knowledge bases such as Uniprot, extraction of BioPAX-like interactions, e.g., phosphorylation, complex assembly, positive/negative regulations, and coreference resolution, for both entities and interactions.  

Reach is developed using [Odin](https://github.com/clulab/processors/wiki/ODIN-(Open-Domain-INformer)), our open-domain information extraction framework, which is released within our [`processors`](https://github.com/clulab/processors) repository.

# Licensing
All our own code is licensed under Apache License Version 2.0. **However, some of the libraries used here, most notably CoreNLP, are GPL v2.** If `BioNLPProcessor` is not removed from this package, technically our whole code becomes GPL v2 since `BioNLPProcessor` builds on Stanford's `CoreNLP` functionality. Soon, we will split the code into multiple components, so licensing becomes less ambiguous.

# Changes
+ **1.2.2** - Added cellular locations to context. Context engine now can be configured by the user. Added a new deterministic context policy that extends context before and after a mention. Added support for Pandas output format. Bug fixes: context is now enabled by default; coref engine now matches the Hobbs antecedent search heuristic. 
+ **1.2.1** - Bug fix in the unboxing of controller events. New Year's Eve release!
+ **1.2.0** - First release of context extraction! Context includes: species, organs, cell lines and types. Improved coreference resolution with constraints on determiner type.

# Installation

This software requires Java 1.8, Scala 2.11, and CoreNLP 3.x or higher.

The `jar` is available on Maven Central. To use, simply add the following dependency to your `pom.xml`:

    <dependency>
       <groupId>org.clulab</groupId>
       <artifactId>reach_2.11</artifactId>
       <version>1.2.2</version>
    </dependency>

 The equivalent SBT dependencies are:

    libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
        "clulab.org" %% "reach" % "1.2.2"
    )

# How to compile the source code

This is a standard sbt project, so use the usual commands (i.e. `sbt compile`, `sbt assembly`, etc) to compile.
Add the generated jar files under `target/` to your `$CLASSPATH`, along with the other necessary dependency jars. Take a look at `build.sbt` to see which dependencies are necessary at runtime.

# How to use it

## Running the system on a directory of NXML papers

The most common usage of Reach is to parse a directory containing one or more papers in the NXML format.
In order to run the system on such a directory of papers, you must create a `.conf` file.  See `src/main/resources/application.conf` for an example configuration file.  The directory containing NXML files should be specified using the `nxmlDir` variable.

`sbt "runMain edu.arizona.sista.reach.ReachCLI /path/to/yourapplication.conf"`

If the configuration file is omitted, Reach uses the default `.conf`. That is, the command:

`sbt "runMain edu.arizona.sista.reach.ReachCLI"`

will run the system using the `.conf` file under `src/main/resources/application.conf`.

## Running the interactive Reach shell for rule debugging

`sbt "runMain edu.arizona.sista.reach.ReachShell"`

enter `:help` to get a list of available commands.

# Modifying the code
Reach builds upon our Odin event extraction framework. If you want to modify event and entity grammars, please refer to [Odin's Wiki](https://github.com/sistanlp/processors/wiki/ODIN-(Open-Domain-INformer)) page for details. Please read the included Odin manual for details on the rule language and the Odin API.

# Reach web services

We have developed a series of web services on top of the Reach library. All are freely available [here](http://agathon.sista.arizona.edu:8080/odinweb/).

# Reach datasets

We have generated multiple datasets by reading publications from the [open-access PubMed subset](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/tools/openftlist/) using Reach. All datasets are freely available [here](https://github.com/clulab/reach/wiki/Datasets).

# Funding

The development of Reach was funded by the [DARPA Big Mechanism program](http://www.darpa.mil/program/big-mechanism) under ARO contract W911NF-14-1-0395.
